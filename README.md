I worked on augmented reality (AR) for Astronomy in the [2024 3M Young Scientist Challenge](https://youngscientistlab.com/). My project focused on audio augmentation for Astronomy, translated 3-dimensional constellation data to short music, or â€œsound logos," with a music-theoretic algorithm and implemented the proposed constellation sonifier as a handheld device. When the device is pointed to the night sky, it searches a constellation in its direction and plays a sound logo for it.
