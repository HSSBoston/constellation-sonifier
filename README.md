## Audio Augmentation for Celestial Objects: Sonifying Constellations and Mapping their Sound Logos onto the Night Sky

I worked on augmented reality (AR) for Astronomy in the [2024 3M Young Scientist Challenge](https://youngscientistlab.com/). My project focused on audio augmentation for Astronomy, translated astronomical data, particularly constellation data, into short music (or â€œsound logos") with a music-theoretic algorithm  and implemented the proposed constellation sonifier as a handheld device. When the device is pointed to the night sky, it searches a constellation in its direction and plays a sound logo for it.
